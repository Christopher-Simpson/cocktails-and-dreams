# UX

## Strategy Plane

### Project Goals

To create a static webpage that uses HTML, CSS and in this case The Bootstrap 5 framework. To create a site from the viewpoint of a 1980's bar owner. Taking the aethetics of the 80's and merging it with modern web design the goal is to bring a new more bolder and less subtle approach to web design. I imagined what a highflying 80s guy would think vs what a modern devolper would think is correct and tried to marry this clash of styles as a fun way to engage with the project and challenge myself to learn more things that were outside of the lesson content.

## User Stories 

### Site Owner
As a site owner I want to promote my restaurant business to a wider audience.

As a site owner I want my customers to be able to get a feeling for the atmosphere inside my bar.

As a site owner I want to speak directly to the public about what I am offering.

### Site User
As a user I want to see what services this business provides

As a user I want to be able to see what products are available before I make my decision to visit.

As a user I want to be able to find suggestions on when will be the best time to visit. 

## Site Goals
To target B2C segment by presenting information in a dynamic and aethetically pleasing way that both defines the brand of the business and delivers content that is useful to the user.

### Strategy - design

#### Color Palette
To represent the time period this business promotes a bold pallette of pinks and blues is used to color the design language of the site.

#### Links
Links are represented in an off white and when hovered brightness turns up and a glow surrounds the link to give an impression of a neon sign. This lets the user know that it is an active link that can be clicked for more information.

#### content
Content is placed into divs that have bold background colors. These content divs are slanted and have been given box shadows and z indexes that allow them to layer on top of each other creating a 3d shadow effect. This is to engage the user with a fun and dynamic presentation representative of the experience they will recieve when visiting the site owners business. The slanted divs also represent a new way to tell the user that more information is available on scroll. When viewing the content of one section the next section appears as a colored triangle inviting the user to scroll further


#### landing section
A looping mp4 will welcome the user visiting on desktop devices showing them what happens inside the site owners restaurant. Mobile device visitors will be treated to a carousel of high resolution images representative of the products available inside the restuarant.

#### Priority of information
The business is primarily a bar operating during covid restrictions. The first most important information given is an option for takeways.

Secondly is upcoming events

Third is an invitation to connect via social networks

An option to sign up for communication with the business is then presented

Finally the menu is presented.

The menu is chosen to be presented last as it gives the site owner the opportunity to present marketing opportunities to the user.

## Scope

### Requirements

#### Responsive design
The site needs to be responsive to accomodate users of various device sizes. To implement this bootstrap 5 grid along with CSS Grid and Flexbox has been used along with media queries to ensure all information is presented attractively across all device sizes.

#### Signup from
A form for users wishing to sign up for mail list must be provided for marketing opportunities. 

A form is implemented but currently does not function as intended.

#### Modal
Modal to present information to the user without diverting away from the site or loading new pages. This will allow for easier and faster navigation.

Modals implemented to keep a fast one page design

## Structure 

Information is presented by priority of information both in page layout and represented in link order in the navigation menu.

### Interaction
The user can interact with the information presented with active links directing to specific parts of the page and in the events section modals that present more detailed information then what is available in the events grid.

## Skeleton

### Navigational Elements
Navigational elements are represented in an off white color. When hovered they increase in brightness and gain an outer glow. This represents a neon light turning on and tells the user that clicking on the light leads to more information. 

### Page Structure
The slanted divs on the page tell the user that there is more information to be seen if they scroll further. It also represents a design language that is not very common and therefore more exciting. This fits with the goals of the owner to present information in a fun way.

## Debugging
### Images and Video causing slow loading times and porr rendering
My image files and video files were much to large in a previous version causing slow downs.

Fixed by compressing and reuploading images

### Left over space at bottom of screen due to divs being repositioned
#### Expected
Content divs overlapping without leaving a space
#### Result
Space of excatly the amount of pixels the divs were translated allowing the background splash to show through the bottom of the page

#### Testing
Tested resizing the divs to fill gap - No Result

Tested adding in a filler div to fill the gap - No Result

#### Fix
Tested adding in a filler div and then recaling its size to fill the gap

##### Debug Result
Gap filled however Footer section now expanded bigger than it should be. If I had not mismanaged my time I would have found a more elegant solution.
